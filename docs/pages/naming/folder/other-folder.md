## Other Folder Naming

Other folder naming outsing pages use **$**.\
By doing this we distinct the pages folder with other folder,\
and it is easier too with Next JS App Router.

```sh
.
├── user /
│   ├── management/
│   │   ├── $action
│   │   └── $element
│   └── $action
└── $navigator
```

Every page has component (card, box, modal, .etc) and the component should be named as **_$element_**\
Function naming you can also use **_$function_** as the naming folder.
