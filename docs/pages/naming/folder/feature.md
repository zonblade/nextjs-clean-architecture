## Feature Naming

On feature, name it based on what scope it is.\
Example for feature like _management user_, the scope is _user_ and the feature is _management_

```sh
.
└── app /
    └── user/
        └── management
```

By **scoping** the feature we can add **more feature** regarding the scope **seemlesly**.
